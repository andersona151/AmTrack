# AmeriTrack Capstone Project -- Equipment Tracking

The development team contracted by Railserve will be designing an embedded system paired with an application to provide reports and real-time analytics. The application will display location with respect to time, and the state of the equipment in the field. Railserve proposed this project as means to track the location of their equipment and determine the amount of usage the equipment receives. As a result of these requirements the design team will approach it in a modular format splitting it into a front-end application to display reports, back-end data storing, and a hardware module for data collecting from the field.

The embedded hardware will be connected to the battery of the equipment gathering data as to when it is on or off, and its location. This information is to be sent to a database for storing, followed by an application displaying the data in a report format for simple analysis. The importance of this project for Railserve is to be able to know the time duration for which the equipment is in use and its location. As a business the information acquired by our embedded tool will lead to a better analysis of the frequency at which the equipment is utilized.  

As a method to complete this project the development team will use an AGILE development lifecycle. This will allow for the creation of an alpha and beta prototype before a final tool is given to Railserve. The team will also provide documentation such as specifications for what was requested in the development (SRS),  design documents (SDD), and a protocol for how the embedded tool should be used. 

This proposal covers the general information for an equipment utilization tracking project. Our development team designed this proposal consisting of our objectives, technical approach, a tentative project schedule, tentative deliverables, current budget, and team qualifications as a running document to aid the production of the tracking unit.
